We stand firmly planted in a visual world,
surrounded by a universe of things to
look at. Images flicker from televisions,
iPads, computer monitors and more
large as towering billboards and as
small as compact cell phones. Such
images provide us with clues about our
environment, feeding our mind with
information that we find useful for survival
or for orientation purposes. But these
very same images clutter the horizon and
prevent us from discerning what is truly
important. How do we tell them apart?
*It appears to be that the Soviet
socialist realism was the main branch
of modernism, the most consistent one
if not the main, at least the equal. The
western pluralism created the conditions
of chaotic development, of the game with
no rules. Our evolution, on the contrary,
went on scientifically. And finally, leaves
of ash-tree appeared in the birch...*

Within my topic I want to research and observe mainstreem style that
comes from past. Find the link between 90’s of east europe and nowadays
of west europe. Since I was a child of big Perestoyka times when USSR
collapsed and my parents were the one who leaved two lives (before and
after the big wall) I have a big background and information source do
discover and compare.
It was the 90’s that put an end to censorship and created the impression
of total freedom. The early 90’s, one of the most controversial times in the
recent history of the former Soviet republics, was an era of cultural upsurge.
The new Post Soviet aesthetic is the epitome of postmodern irony with its
crazy, incoherent, starling mixture of allusions and motifs. The new collides
with the old in quirky ways.
With its candor and irony, wit and simplicity of design, the new Soviet
aesthetic has garnered hype for a good reason. It’s exciting to watch this
style evolve as designers discover new inspirations within the Soviet cultural
legacy.
