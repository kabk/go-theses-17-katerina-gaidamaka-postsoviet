<p><b>***
this is going to be one of those nights
this is going to be big
this is going to hurt

i am bored
i am beyonce
i am become death 

***
my brain is vibrating 
my brain is very slow
my brain is on vocation
my brain vs the world

***
how many fools can i kill today
how many friends

***
i am looking for a job
i am looking for a miracle
i am looking for a new opportunity because
i am looking for an honest man 

i like turtles
i like to move it
i like my monsters rare

***
i am a legend
i am a leaf on the wind watch how i soar
i am a little teapot
i am a loser


***
to be loved is to be known
to be loved is to be destroyed
to be loved is to see the face of god


**
I used to be warrior like you
I used to know star wars

***
but the bear has heart of gold
but the tigers come at night
but the blood
but the absence of the light is necessary part

***
i am the good sister or evil one
i am the god of hellfire
i am good shepherd 

***
where is my mind
where am i 
where is chuck norris 
where the wild roses grow

***
they all laughed 
they all hate us
they all float down here
they all asked for you 


***
I can’t gat high
i can’t get hard
i can’t get her out of my mind

***
my inner things are flat
my inners chest won’t grow
my inner machinations of my mind are an enigma
my inner burning


***
I crave raw meat
i crave red meat
i crave romance

***
perhaps i had a wicked childhood
perhaps i have changed since then 
perhaps i have special anus 
perhaps i have the strength after all

***
the end of history
the end justifies the means
the end of the internet 
the end of history beer


***
and the snakes start to sing
and the mountains echoed
and we dance

***
there is no present for future 
there is no need to be upset 
there is no spoon 
there is no god
there is no try 



***
see the bigger picture 
see the beauty in everything
see the ball feel the ball be the ball
see the bombers fly up 

***
i need my own place 
i need my own room 
i need my own country

***
let the right one in
let the bodies hit the floor
let the sunshine in
let the good times roll


***
we emerge as they fade away 
we empty rooms
we emergency
we embrace saturdays 


***
I can be your hero baby
i can break these cuffs
i can be your queen bee
i can be the one 

***
i know a vampire
i know a valley my secret valley
i know avril lavigne

***
can a ghost follow you home
can a ghost hurt you 
can a ghost fall in love with a human
can a ghost touch you


****
that day i cut my throat
that day i wore yoga pants
that day i’ll always remember

***
you must be born again
you must be a basketballplayer
you must be fun at parties
