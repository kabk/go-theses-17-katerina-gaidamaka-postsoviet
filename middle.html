This thesis was written from the stories of my grandparents. They have made a significant contribution to my research. Gaidamaka Anatolij & Mishenko Larisa who are national artists of Ukraine, they passed through two lives - until the collapse of the Union and after. Most of the information is from the stories of my parents, who grew up in the turning point of the country.
