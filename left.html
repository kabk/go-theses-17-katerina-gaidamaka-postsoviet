<h1 id="intro" name="intro">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>It seems as though time has stopped. Our lives are
full of events but they do not bring about much that
is new. Progress seems to be met with an invisible
wall. Living in two countries relatively opposite to
one another, I began to understand that in my foreign
reality, was an emergence of a Post-Soviet style—if
it even can be called “style”. As a child of the former
Soviet Union, I experienced a lot of the changes that
occurred as a result of the social crisis caused by the
Dashing 90’s. I also witnessed a certain advancement
of our cultural aspirations for something new. Of
course, Europe and America have always served
as points of reference. As soon as the Soviet wall
collapsed it seemed that the impossible was possible.
Suddenly, there was a huge amount of information
available with which many people could not deal.
And still, people were still trying to understand how
to be more like Europe. Both then and now former
members of the Soviet Union attempt to imitate all that
is foreign. Ironically enough it is now Europe that is
preoccupied with the aesthetics of Post-Soviet Union
culture. It ends up being somewhat of a ridiculous
cycle of aesthetic copycatting between Europe and
post-Soviet countries. Confusing? Yes, a little bit.
But I find myself curious about the nature of this
exchange. How did the poverty of our post-Soviet
Union countries attract the attention of our foreign
neighbours? And how have changes since the collapse
of the Soviet Union influenced style and design? And
how does what was going on with society back then
compare to what is going on now? How did this sort of
a sudden ‘social realism’ begin to appear?
Now we stand firmly planted in a visual world,
surrounded by a universe of things to look at. Images
flicker from televisions, iPads, computer monitors
and more—media as large as towering billboards
and as small as compact cell phones. These images
provide us with clues about our environment and
feed our minds with information that we find useful
for survival or for orientation purposes. But these
very same images clutter the horizon and prevent us
from discerning what is truly important. The Internet
is the decisive technology of the Information Age.
There is no information wall anymore what influence
the growth of potential and development.Our current
“network society” is a product of the digital revolution
and some major socio cultural changes.
In my thesis I would like to dive into the origin of
Post-Soviet culture and aesthetics. What factors
influenced on its formation. How taste and identity and
Soviet mentality was developed and what happened
to the style in the design and outlook of Post-Soviet
individual. How did style evolve into identity of the
modern individual and why nowadays we see Post-
Soviet aesthetics in the Western parts?</p>

<h3 id="post3" name="post3">DESIGN IN UKRAINE</h3>
<p>The political and economic crisis of the 1990s
also affected the development of design in
Ukraine. It’s style was allocated several parallel
branches. One branch was established as a “new
wave”. In the mid-second half of the 80’s, when
the “new wave” was raging in Western Europe
and the United States, the Soviet Union was just
beginning theoretical and practical development
of the style. There was a delay in its creative
implementation which led to the fact that in the
beginning of the 90s, that style barely reached
the logical conclusion and practical integrity.
Ripening of the “new wave” in the Soviet Union
has greatly contributed to the emergence of
a number of analyzes in specialized journals,
primarily publications <a href="#link5">Fig.5</a>;<a href="#link6"> Fig.6</a> of S. I. Serov.
It caused shock to the adherents of design
style at the turn of 1970-80’s to the beginning
of the 90s when “new wave” became common
phenomenon, so that even to some professionals
it was interpreted as a style that pretend to be a
universal, which “do not obey trends of the time”
Throughout the 90’s the idea of freedom from all
kinds of standards and norms continued to haunt
the minds. Implemented in the framework of
post-modern aesthetics, it gave birth to “broken”
fonts, collage solutions, a number of specific
techniques, flips “upside down” traditional
notions of typography and composition <a href="#link7">Fig.7</a>. The
widespread introduction of computer technology
gave for their incarnations unlimited possibilities.</p>
</div>



<div class="textbox" style="border:0px solid black;width:550px;height:550px;overflow:scroll;">
<h4 id="post4" name="post4">REVISUALIZATION</h4>
<p>The second branch of Post-Soviet graphic design
of the 1990s was a style that emerged in the 70’s
under the influence of functionalist concepts and
ideas of the Bauhaus and the Swiss school of
typography. Prevailed in the world of graphic design
from the late 60s to early 80s, design style with its
conciseness, flatness, functionality, use of space and
an active determinism graphics solutions perceived
as synonymous with professional design. In favor
of the professionalism design showed a systematic
approach, extensive use of scientific knowledge, the
use of the “golden ratio”, a modular grid, and other
ways of proportioning <a href="#link9">Fig.9</a><a href="#link10"> Fig.10</a>.
In the 70’s design style was considered as timeless,
absolute, and the approach that is used to create
graphics solutions, is the only- correct one, because
it allows almost literally “Revisualization” (ie, decrypt)
the visual text.<br><br>
It is known that the development of graphic design in
the following decades refuted this belief: “new wave”
of “exchange” the basic provisions of the design style,
has created a worthy alternative for design. At the end
of the twentieth century the concept of functionalism,
which found expression in the framework of the design
style, has taken its place among the other design
ideologies. This concept is seen today as “classic” graphic design. In the 90’s those who committed
to the design style were the most conservative
design professionals who hold the view that “the
fundamental principle of modern typography -
not a gust of inspiration beyond original intention
<a href="#link8">Fig.8</a>, but the comprehension of fundamental and
universal laws of morphogenesis “ “discipline,
calculation and objectivity” .
Third, the dominant branch of Post-Soviet
graphic design of the 90’s was style, which
was formed under the influence of packaging
and advertising of low-grade foreign products
<a href="#link11">Fig.11</a>; <a href="#link12">Fig.12</a>, invaded the country in the economic
crisis. Various types of imitation, counterfeit and
substandard products only Turkish, Chinese
and Polish handicraft enterprises in bright,
shiny packaging, to create the illusion of luxury,
became a symbol of “the era of the collapse of
the Soviet Union.” For good designer who was
not spoiled by post-consumer packaging, these
was a kind of a window into another world, a
world of abundance, lack of queues and cards
for the purchase of soap, sugar and baby food.
Imported consumer goods packaging quickly
become familiar and recognizable, they entered
the life and consciousness of the consumer
as a kind of integrity which logically continues
the tradition of the “commercial” style of prerevolutionary
era <a href="#link13">Fig.13</a>; <a href="#link16">Fig.16</a>. The aesthetics of
poverty generated by hungry post-consumer
consciousness, were based on polychrome,
a maximum saturation graphic pictorial plane
and font elements and all sorts of ornaments
and decorative details, the use of metallic
inks and other attributes of abundance. For
the graphic design of the newly independent
states to return to pre-revolutionary methods
of advertising was a manifestation of growing
pains. Characteristically, as “commercial” style
of the late nineteenth century, “new commercial”
cosmopolitan <a href="#link15">Fig.15</a>. Graphic designs of this style
for example in Russia and Belarus, Uktraine
virtually have no difference from each other.
Modern technologies, new packaging materials
and extensive printing capabilities allow “newold”
style to adapt successfully to the needs of
the late twentieth century consumers. However,
as the graphic design of a century ago, samples
of “new commercial” style easily recognisable.
Thanks to a compilation, naive, unprofessional
design. Low artistic level of these samples is“invitingly” solutions <a href="#link14">Fig.14</a>. 
The authors of most of
these developments were amateur artists which lead
to a lack of a sense of proportion.
Popularization of “commercial” style of the
former Soviet Union contributed to the massive
impoverishment of the people, put them in front of
the problem of physical survival. This has resulted
in a decline in their cultural needs. In addition, the
abolition of the arts council system, acting within the
scope of art mills and funds of USSR paved the way
for amateurs, made the situation with the development
of graphic design uncontrolled. Arts Council prevented
the replication of weak, non-professional development.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
reduction of public sector project approval stage has
been eliminated - such matters are dealt with in the eld
of commercial directors of companies. This caused a
decrease in the level of aesthetic development in the
field of graphic design, led to the mass introduction to
the profession amateurs. The widespread development
of computer technology users also contributed to the
popularization of the “commercial” style, because
within the style, called here as a “new commercial”,
often realized themselves amateurs.
Style, resuscitation and adaptation which contribute
to the economic circumstances of the late twentieth
century, exists in the Ukrainian graphic design to this
day, satisfying the needs of the aesthetically “lowly”
consumer. The ability of “new business” to mimic
the style, the low cultural level of the majority of the
population, as well as the economic order reasons
give grounds to assert that this style will keep their
positions in the coming years.
As the conclusion, the nature of Ukrainian graphic
design 90’s of 20th century was defined by three main
styles: inertial manifestations of the “new wave” style,
“classical” branch comes from the design style of the
70’s, and the “new commercial” style. <a href="#link17">Fig.17</a>;<a href="#link18"> Fig.18</a>)

<h5 id="post5" name="post5">IMPACT</h5>
<p>Researching the nature of artistic styles, determine the
development of Ukrainian graphic design in the 90’s of
the twentieth century, the logic of their development
is extremely important in order to understanding the
future prospects of Ukrainian graphic design.
But at the turn of the 80s and 90s suddenly it turned
out that all design was very necessary, and then
immediately came personal computers with graphics
programs - and began the mass reproduction
of uniquely Soviet aesthetic values. It is often
uneducated and uncultured producers, attempting
only to gain commercial advantage that seek this
(commonly far from the reality)representation of
beauty. In the other words, everything had to look
luxurious or rich. However, when Internet-era started
and graphic design first began to take off in the 90s,
there wasn’t a lot of deviation from the first designs.
People tended to use a lot of the same techniques to
create quite a bit of similar content. Slowly but surely,
people began to deviate from the technique and began
to create content in new ways <a href="#link19">Fig.19</a>.
Today, on the Post-Soviet space, there has been a
resurgence of similar dirty aesthetics displayed in
the trends of fashion and art as well. Small-format
pictures, ugly frames and curly, bible, standard fonts.
All of that is reminiscent of the design of 15 years ago
when people were first experimenting with everything.
The fatter, richer and brighter it looks the more it will
attract the attention. Now, all the clichés and ugly low
quality design again in trend. It is like a time machine
back to the years 1995-2000 where the experimentation
with technology was more important than actual
design aesthetics <a href="#link20">Fig.20</a>. Here, only in my homeland—
Ukraine, has everything stayed the same. Of course
new styles and more advanced levels of technological
knowledge is way higher but still seems to be delayed
on a few years. The mentality is still one of hunting
for new trends in design but somehow negligence
and clichés along with its bombastic aesthetics are
back or they just never disappeared. Nowadays, it is
interesting to see that in western countries -poor Post-
Soviet aesthetics have become the new inspiration.
And why has this seemed to have occurred during 21
century - of great progress and new developments.
For people from Post-Soviet countries it is more
clear. I think we do not fully know how to navigate the 
digital space yet and it is all more fine art rather than
design. Of course we have number of respectable
artists but somehow many of them were learning the
principles of art and design and grabbing knowledge
abroad. Unfortunately our Academies are still full of
soviet professors who cannot provide enough for new
generation. Perhaps the most perplexing in the state
in the post-design is a complete lack of good teachers
and specialists.</p>

<h6 id="post6" name="post6">THE BIRTH OF POST-SOVIET RAVE</h6>
<p style="background-color:blue;">
There were no raves in the Soviet Union. Even in the
early 90’s, when the rest of the world seemed to be on
a constant bender, Moscow was pitch-black come at
9pm. There were no fashion and culture magazines
to help guide the attributes of youth we take for
granted these days. The Soviet idea of youth <a href="#link21">Fig.21</a> was
completely sterile, limited to portraits of wide-eyed
adolescent heroes from socialist murals.
Young people of the 90’s were the first generation
<a href="#link22">Fig.22</a> to live a life radically different from those of
their parents. Excited by the sudden avalanche of
western pop culture, they were eager to trash the
past, and, more importantly, to use the seemingly
endless possibilities of the new free world to have
fun and create. Founding editors of underground
culture magazines, Igor Shulinsky of “Ptyuch”
<a href="#link23">Fig.23</a> and Igor Grigoriev of “OM” <a href="#link24">Fig.24</a> were the true
pioneers of early Russian youth culture. Although
these two publications are largely forgotten in Russia,
and remain almost completely unknown in the rest
of the world, they act as a now-secret guide to the
outrageous, innovative visions incorporated into the
DNA of almost every cutting-edge creative to come out
of Post-Soviet block.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbox"style="background-color: GreenYellow;color:OrangeRed;">
<h7 id="post7" name="post7">POST-SOVIET IS MORE THAN JUST AN AESTHETIC</h7>
<p>The main point of attraction is arguably the aura of
exoticism that still surrounds the Post-Soviet bloc. For
more than 50 years the Soviet Union remained a totally
closed, isolated society, inaccessible for outsiders,
mysterious and vaguely threatening. That’s why its
collapse presented a sort of social conundrum to the
rest of the world – in a rapidly globalizing world, the
countries and cultures of the former Soviet Union were
strikingly different and unfamiliar. However, from the
Post-Soviet perspective, it was the outer world that
seemed an exotic and unknown place. Despite the mild
democratization that started in the Soviet Union in
the 80’s. Western art and literature, just like the home
dissident and underground culture, were still hard to
get one’s hands on.
It was the 90’s that put an end to censorship and
created the impression of total freedom <a href="#link25">Fig.25</a>; <a href="#link26">Fig.26</a>. The
early 90’s, one of the most controversial times in the
recent history of the former Soviet republics, was an
era of powerful cultural upsurge. Art and literature that
had been banned before – including aspects of socalled
dissident, underground Soviet culture as well as
Western culture – could now be accessed freely.
The new Post-Soviet aesthetic is the epitome of
postmodern irony with its crazy, incoherent, startling
mixture of allusions and motifs. The strength of the
new set of East European creatives is their ability to
move freely between the global culture and the culture
of the former Soviet Union, connecting East and West
in a way the politics never could.</p>

</div>


<div class="textbox" style="border:0px solid black;width:550px;height:350px;overflow:scroll;">
<h8 id="post8" name="post8">THE INFLUX OF WESTERN CULTURE IN THE EAST</h8>
<p>This created opportunities that the Soviet creative
scene had never known before. The masses were
fascinated by the arrival of international magazines
and the newly-attained availability of Hollywood
cinema that were rapidly incorporated in the popular
culture. The now-iconic Titanic hoodie by Vetements
is also a piece inspired by the Eastern European
1990s that were literally flooded with cheap T-shirts
decorated with poorly-made prints.
At the same time, it was not only Western culture
that was imported, but – following the deregulation
of the economy – the principles of the Western
consumerism, which was a complete novelty at the
time. In the Soviet Union, goods from the West, like
jeans or Coca-Cola, had had an almost mythical status
and were now being imported freely. Brands and logos
were being discovered and re-invented; turning into
the symbols of the new order. <a href="#link30">Fig.30</a></p>

<h9 id="post9" name="post9">CRAZY MIX</h9>
<p>People of Post-Soviet times who escaped from
gayness and deficit, like natives on beads, eagerly
snapped up all bright imported goods with unfamiliar
foreign names that were sold at the outdoor markets
(Fig.36). From Soviet consumer low quality trash and
imported clothes , crazy haircuts and eternal feeling to
be cool and fashionable . (Fig.37) “Adidas”, “Montana”,
“Mawin” - magic brands of those times that
overlapped high fashion names like “Prada” , “D&G”
and all others. However, later on exactly the same
bright colorful t-shirts out there, there flashed a wry
embroidered letters that make up the magical Versace,
Gucci, Trussardi and ... Phuket. People dressed in
their own way. In place of Soviet austerity eclecticism
came in look of the people, to asymmetric cut, color
“plucked eyes” . Everybody wanted to stand out. But
mostly they did not know how (Fig.33; Fig. 34). Nevertheless,
today many are nostalgic for the “Dashing 90s.” (Fig.35)
Wearing jeans, “Malvina” Moscow “Adidas” (Fig.38)
or unnamed Turkish leatherette shoes, a sweater
and a baseball cap Boys USA California. The most
fashionable shoes of the late 80’s, early 90’s were
Moscow’s version of “Adidas”— “Adik” (Fig.40). Even in
some places they were called “plug” for a specific type
of sole. If you are not used to their district authority,
in the evening such shoes could easily remove the
person from you that they need more than just a
simple guy from the district. The same anonymous
leatherette shoes, worn by those who can not afford
were “Adik”. It did well very quickly, but that was only
until the soles began to gall off.
Super classic of the 90’s was the boys’ sweater. Even
on the photo you can see how proud this man (Fig.39) is
of himself just because of the fact that he is put in this
masterpiece of Turkish consumer goods. Required
attribute of a tough guy - Montana electronic watch,
another classic of the 90’s, USA California. Even
the men most unfamiliar with fashion from the most
remote villages would wear them. Money clips were
another staple from the 90’s. They were worn at the
waist. Girls in enjoyed the boys style sweaters too.
Trousers, chains also became mainstream at that time.
All the goods were usually sold at the outdoor markets
that exist till nowadays with the same products.(Fig.41)
Everything what was not production of Post-Soviet
considered to be the best thing ever you can have.
Like a slogan of Post-Soviet generation that still
existing in its big value. In Ukraine and the countries
of the former Soviet Union we remember 90’s
with share of horror: chaos reigned on the streets
bordering on anarchy, and deliberate bad taste and
vulgarity was all the rage.

<div class="textbox" style="border:0px solid black;width:750px;height:250px;overflow:scroll;">
<h10 id="post10" name="post10">ENDANGERED SPECIES</h10>
<p>Besides not familiar to me interest of the Post-Soviet
aesthetics and slavic society. It is amazing to regard
the hype surrounding low class lifestyle and total
rejection of any sorts of standards. For me its more
likely a fearful reaction to see Post-Soviet aesthetics
rather than feeling nostalgia of 90’s .
To the side of disadvantaged whites the last time
we saw them in the early 90’s2. Europe exploit
aesthetics of the Post-Soviet street muggers, who
are called “Gopnik”: new GOP-style excites, like all
ugly or pathological. As one example of 2 (Fig.43; Fig.44)
photos: you see the difference? I’m not, just know
that some are natives of criminal structures and other
is a modern individual imitating them without even
knowing all the pitfalls. So who are these Gopnik (Fig.42)
and whom are they like?
While it is important to understand that some people
are raised in a system of low socioeconomic status
and social structures of criminality, we must also
recognize the implications of modern individuals
imitating them without even understanding the
background of the ‘aesthetic’.

<h id="post11_1" name="post11_1">TYPICAL REAL BOY “GOP-STYLE”
IN OVERSIMPLIFIED WORDS</h>
<p style="background-color:blue;">How to distinguish such an individual (Fig.45)? The
first thing that defines a ‘real boy’ - ‘ pacan’ of
course a flat Capcom also a favorite thing of rural
workers or visitors from the southern republics.
Cheap mass-produced Chinese clothing: “Adidas”,
“Nike”, “Everlast”, “M1-sport” - especially popular in
post-Soviet counties are the thousands of Chinese
companies that would simply print or embroider
the word “Russia” on items. Also popular are
“racing” costumes like pilots of Formula 1 have or
motorcyclists. The more different inscriptions and
incomprehensible words, brands with “accidental”
mistakes and prefixes : Rasing Suzuka, Marldoro
Racing, Super Cup, or just a meaningless set of sharp
words: super, turbo, mega, racing - fool loves red.
It was a time when hat with inscription “228” was
‘glamoures’. On feet worn shoes with long noses -
“pedals”, certainly dusty, or sneakers. In the summer
as an alternative to sandals on bare feet, people
preferred the cheapest Chinese sandals on top of
socks. The preferred type of the bag to carry was a
fanny pack. It is favored because of the lack of all
sorts of straps, in which ‘gopnik’ may get confused
and lost. They usually wear fanny-pack under the
arm and actually there is nothing to put there in as
‘sigi’- cigarets, ‘zhuga’-lighter, ‘mobila’-phone and
pack of sun-seeds all that in the pockets of leotard
or jacket. If a ‘real boy’ does not have fanny pack it is
also acceptable is to use a plastic bag, rolled into a
kind of handy. All outlook is selected with a great love
and passion to the black color. Shoes, pants, socks,
sportswear, caps, hats and of-course leather jackets -
ideally all black . What eventually makes sense - dirt,
blood is not visible and of-course looks cool and bae
likes. A sort of absolute coolness and style. (Fig.46; Fig.47)

<h11 id="post11" name="post11">In the open spaces of Europe</h11>
<p>Today in the mass media and in the open spaces
of Europe appears the aesthetics (Fig.48) of Post-
Soviet dashing 90s. In fact, street fashionistas have
long mixed luxury brands with “lower” sportswear
brands (Fig.49), not to mention stylists who are now
popularizing the combination of evening clothes
with sporty clothes—high to low in order to with the
glamorize the most unassuming things. Just now the
boundaries are erased completely. Nothing to mix
no longer need - hoodies, suspiciously reminiscent
of iconic sports goods giants are easily found in the
collections of fashion houses, so far had only a luxury
status. Cashmere coats on the podium for a long time
to look like someone else’s shoulder, fur coats made
of precious rocks worn with torn jeans, and hoodies
giant - with lace skirts and dresses. Linen replace
clothes, and fragments of military uniforms are in
use. All this hype surrounding Gopnik style has led
to the rise of the shaved head/bald girl model. Gopnik
should also be shaved: those present, the sample
1920- not to lice infested, and later, from the nostalgic
1990s - fleeing to bully it was impossible to catch the
hair. From those same shaved heads, who many will
remember from our 1990, that called dashing. Many
people remember and sweat pants tucked into socks,
sweaters tucked into jeans, caps and indispensable to
those same shaved heads. (Fig.50; Fig.51)
Then the most colorful were, of course, “Lubero” near
Moscow pitching, keep at bay the entire capital. They
are professionally engaged in sports and were proud
of their muscles - exactly how modern it girls, who
run at the Patriarch and boxing on the “Red October”.
On the beautiful trained bodies all this deliberately
‘county side’ clothes look is still very different than in
grungy 1990, when the fashion was stooped and sullen
teenage girls.
Summing up I want to say that trend, this time is 90’s
(Fig.52), early 2000’s, when walking through the streets
homeless, ourished banditry and lawlessness.</p>

had a hard times. The 90’s in Post-Soviet space was

<p>Lets go step by step. How post soviet aesthetics
came into the life of modern individual (Fig.54). Nearest
trend came from overflow of brands and trends so
contemporary individual became over- owed and went
for radically opposite way where basic idea is to be
impersonal. As everybody. In the Post-Soviet reality
format, this situation causes a slight confusion. In fact,
the overall concept involves primarily adapted to any
environment and to any community.

What means that you do not need the freedom to
be someone special. Individuality in that new wave
was not welcome. Freedom is necessary to become

that community are constantly changing each time
trying on a new lifestyle. (Fig.55).
The Post-Soviet individual is more difficult, of course.
We love clothes. We like to dress up (Fig.57). To show
up and use all the clichés. All the same comes for
the design (Fig.56). It’s all about who has the best selfpromotion.
So even the concept of “ordinary Russian
crowd” does not accept simplicity - “people from
the subway” just aspire to high fashion, preferring
anonymous backpack fake web “Vuitton” that many
still causes rejection and snobbery.</p>

<p>Post-Soviet countries have always been a supplier
of the wild content on the Internet, giving rise to the
English-speaking Internet meme “Meanwhile in Russia”
(Fig.57; Fig.59). However, what is happening in recent times, it
has nothing to do with exploding brain recordings with
DVRs and drunk, which until recently were responsible
for Russia’s image on the Internet. We completely
inexplicably turned out to be all the rage - and this at a
time when it appears that the Cold War did not stay in
the past century, and like as not even ended seriously.
Along with revolution, conflict and economic crisis, the
country is also subject to a new wave of creative talent.
Eventually it always comes bit-by-bit. Phenomenon of
popularity of Post-Soviet mentality in contemporary
western trends became the next step of young
generation.
“Ugliness is more inventive than beauty. Beauty always
follows certain camps. I think its more amusing -
ugliness - than beauty”
- said Umberto Eco3
(Fig.60; Fig.61)
Current fashion completely agree with him. Swollen
kneed sweat pants and socks with sandals on the
guys; faded dress with ruffles in small floral patterns
on girls; worn jeans all in a row. The world fell in love
with fashion familiar images of people from the former
Eastern bloc. Now Europe with fascination are looking
at them as into an abyss. Post ‘Perestroika’5 lifestyle
and brutal reality of the dark alleys of sleeping areas - a
source of new fashion aesthetic.

<h15 id="post15" name="post15">We are still in 90’s</h15>
<p>Going back to the development of the design on a
Post-Soviet space and what is the situation nowadays.
In the 1990s, among the graphic design styles of
the former Soviet republics dominant position took
style, which was formed under the influence of
packaging (which can be also a metaphor for style
of individual, package as an outlook) (Fig.67; Fig. 68) and
advertising of low-grade foreign products, filling
markets during the economic crisis. Various types of
imitation, unknown manufacturers counterfeiting and
substandard products simply handicraft Turkish and
Chinese enterprises in the bright, shiny packaging,
to create the illusion of luxury, became a symbol
of “the era of the collapse of the Union.” For not
spoiled by good design Post-Soviet consumer those
packages were a kind of a window into another
world. A world of abundance, absence of queues
and cards for the purchase of soap, sugar and baby
food packaging. Imported consumer goods have
quickly became familiar and recognisable, it entered
into everyday life and consciousness of people as
a certain integrity, logically continues the tradition
of the “commercial” style of pre-revolutionary era.
Poverty aesthetics generated by the hungry mind
of Post-Soviet consumer which was based on the
polychrome, the maximum saturation of the graphics
plane pictorial and font elements, all sorts of
ornaments and decorative details, the use of combined
packaging materials and metallic inks (another coil in
the development of “commercial” style, conditioned
by achievements in the printing industry) and plenty
of other attributes. Typically, “new commercial” (Fig.69)
style of 90’s of XX century was manifested mainly
in the packaging, - in total conditions of deficit -
advertising as a means of product promotion on
the market loses its meaning, and in a progressive
inflation could cause negative social consequences.
For the graphic design of the young states, barely
gained independence, return to a pre-revolutionary
methods of advertising was the manifestation of
illnesses of growth (fear to return back to the past
of soviet standards). It should be noted that, as
“commercial” style of the late nineteenth century,
“new commercial” is cosmopolitan. Graphic design
of this style , created for example, in Ukraine, Russia
and Belarus, are virtually indistinguishable, as it is
oriented to certain aesthetic standards.
Modern technologies, new packaging materials and
wide printing possibilities allowed “new-old” style
successfully adapt to the needs of the late twentieth
century consumers. However, as the graphic design
hundred years ago, samples of “new commercial”style easily recognizable due to a compilation, naive,
unprofessional design. The low artistic level of such
samples was partly compensated by increased
commercial assertiveness of decisions. Most of
the authors of such developments same as before
artists amateurs with their typical lack of sense of
proportion - overloaded graphical space, simultaneous
use of multiple typefaces and “uncombinable” colors.
Abolition of the system of Arts Councils that were
operating under combines and foundations in the
USSR, opened the way for dilettantes, that caused
the situation where development of graphic design
became uncontrolled. With the collapse of Union and
reduction in public sector phase of project approvals
has been excluded - such issues were resolved
locally by commercial directors of the companies.
This caused a reduction of aesthetic level of the
development in the field of graphic design. (Fig.77; Fig.78;
Fig.79) Furthermore, it led mass insertion of designersamateurs
into profession, they have mastered the
basic skills of the computer programs but did not
receive any education in the design field.
Characteristically, nowadays “commercial” style
is no longer a sphere of pretensions of creativity
of dilettantes. If in the previous epochs, work of
professionals in this vein were exceptional, then in the
last decade, situation has radically changed. Current
developments of this orientation are more often
professional stylization “under the” commercial “style
of the late nineteenth century.”
Design principle was and still remains on a Post-
Soviet space (Fig.70) - maximum saturation composite
space decorative details and a variety of texts,
simultaneous use of multiple typefaces contributes
to the formation of the image feature of the product,
according to an ancient recipe which are prepared.</p>

<h16 id="post16" name="post16">RECREATED STYLE OF THE POST-SOVIET IN THE
IDENTITY OF MODERN INDIVIDUAL</h16>
<p>The whole modern-postmodern, trans-avantgarde,
pop-art, all this is a reflection. You must go
somewhere. Consumer society - a good reason to take
a heart. And yet how is it that the appearance of the
homeless, criminals and the poor society in the post-
Soviet space has become a fashionable aesthetic and
the trend these days. (Fig.74)
I often ask myself this question walking along the
expanse of Europe and wandering around foreign
web pages (Fig.72; Fig.75). In the Post-Soviet countries, it
is clear - it is still the same fashion, and all the same
stuff from the ‘90s that were hidden away in the attic or
the only thing that is. Just look at the way how modern
society look at the culture and their music and rulles
of those who grow in American ghettos or religious
communities. Soviet Russia and Ukraine before the
revolution were an important part of European culture
even one of its leaders and then suddenly it closed
from everyone and was developing in isolation, cut
off from other countries and in opposition to them.
Of course, now that the walls have fallen, all drew
their attention to the Post Soviet space. Western
people wondering how a society recovering from long
isolation, that could not to not affect on post soviet
individual. (p.18)
Nostalgic time. That’s just life was not so beautiful.
Political and economical crisis had their impact on
everything and everyone. Representatives of the
criminal organizations have taken power. This is part
of the 90’s were hungry. But it is also a time when
it was possible to become rich in a second, or lose
everything. However, at the same time, the insane
and disturbing time. From poverty appeared this
ugly style - rich. This created the illusion of luxury.
Piled permissiveness swept away all boundaries and
has brought to the extreme and absurd. From the
information flow and the impact of foreign countries
emancipated youth movements: skaters, punks and
hip-hopers all new youth raves taking place in parallel
with the Soviet stereotype in which most of the people
from Post-Soviet stayed.
The style tends towards the Post-Soviet youth culture
(Fig.76). The ambiguous situation in the world to wear a
Russian tricolour is considered tough and street style
Post-Soviet youth inspires far more than the already
overexposed American and Japanese fashion. When
Europe falling in love with the post-Soviet style. The
Post-Soviet youth doesn’t care. Communist symbols,
ugly fonts with shadows in gold framework, the
clothes of his father’s shoulder, disharmony, garbage
pictures and poorness- it can be funny there. In Kiev, it
seems a parody of the very rich to the very poor.</p>
